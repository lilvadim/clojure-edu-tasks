; Given an alphabet in form of a list containing 1-character strings and a number N. Define a function that
; returns all the possible strings of length N based on this alphabet and containing no equal subsequent
; characters.
; Use map/reduce/filter/remove operations and basic operations for lists such as str, cons, .concat, etc.
; No recursion, generators or advanced functions such as flatten!
; Example: for the alphabet ("Ð°" "b " "c") and N=2 the result bust be ("ab" "ac" "ba" "bc" "ca" "cb") up to
; permutation.
